            <p>In early spring the leaves have a bold green appearance and can have small white berries. The plant emits a faint smell reminiscent of solvent. In wooded areas (pictured) the leaves will be big and leafy. </p>

            <p>In early summer it tends to turn a dull greenish red. It can be easy to spot in contrast next to blackberries and other plant types, as the leaves become waxy with the poison oil urushiol. In an open field environment (pictured) the plant tends to have smaller leaves.</p>

            <p>In the fall the leaves turn from dull green to red, as the leaves fall off and plant becomes dormant. It may lose it's berries at this stage. Although the plant is in the process of becoming dormant, the oils that cause the rash stick around all year long.</p>

            <p>In the winter time it can become difficult to identify. The leaves drop off and only the vines remain. The best way to identify it at this stage is to look for sticks growing straight up out of the ground with cinnamon colored bark. Although it has become dormant the plant is still infested with Urushiol and just as volatile.  </p>
