                <p>All parts of poison oak contain poisonious oil, Urushiol. Urushiol is highly potent and will cause severe rash and discomfort. The oil binds with skin proteins within 10-15 minutes, making it hard to remove. Rashes can form anywhere from 6 hours to 5 days after exposure.

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Remove oil:</strong> Before treating the rash, make sure all the Urushiol oil has been removed. Suggest using Tecnu Outdoor Skin Cleanser, since it more effective at removing the oil.</li>
              <li><strong>Rash treatment:</strong> Use products that relieve symptoms (itching, burning, oozing, etc). Calagel and other products made by Tecnu are best.</li>
              <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Poison Oak symptoms typically last 5-12 days. You can also use zinc oxide, benedryl, calamine lotion, and other topical products to ease discomfort.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> Tecnu poison oak soap and other products are available at most drug stores. Please make sure the product is safe and will not exacerbate or irriate symptoms. Good luck!</p><br>
